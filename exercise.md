# Emitting BookingMade event

You should already know how to [publish an event in a transaction](/trainings/go-event-driven/exercise/5b87e341-31cc-4b44-bc8b-5da40c8be069)
and [use a forwarder](/trainings/go-event-driven/exercise/6494e13f-eb2e-4aa7-986f-001faf3afd2e).

It's time to use this knowledge in the project!

## Exercise

File: `project/main.go`

Publish the `BookingMade` event during a call to the `POST /book-tickets` endpoint.
It should be emitted in the same transaction as the booking is stored in the database.

The event should be emitted by the forwarder to the Redis Pub/Sub topic `BookingMade` (like other events).
In the payload, you should include the following:
- Booking ID
- Number of tickets
- Customer email
- Show ID

Use the `"events_to_forward"` topic for the forwarder and the default Postgres adapter for SQL Pub/Sub.
Thanks to that, messages will be stored to the `watermill_events_to_forward` table.
**We will use this table to verify your solution.**

You should use the publisher wrapped with the forwarder to create a new instance of the Event Bus per transaction.

Don't forget about passing the context â€” thanks to that you will not lose the correlation ID.
