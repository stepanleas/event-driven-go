# Update component tests

Did you remember to update the component tests?
If not... it's time to do that now!

## Exercise

File: `project/main.go`

Make the component tests work again!

If you want, you can spend some time on checking the idempotency of some scenarios that are not possible to test at the repository level, 
such as issuing receipts. It's critical to make sure that receipts are issued only once for each ticket.
We don't want to mess with the financial team, do we?
