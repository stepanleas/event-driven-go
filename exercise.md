# Storing Shows

Currently, one of Dead Nation's responsibilities is to ensure that we don't sell more tickets than the show's capacity.

To validate how many tickets we can sell, we need to store information about the show:


- Show ID
- Dead Nation's show ID (this is the ID that we'll send to Dead Nation)
- Number of available tickets
- Show start time
- Show title
- Venue name

The show creation request has this format:

```json
{
  "dead_nation_id": "d0b9d5a0-8e1f-4b1a-9f1a-0e8f5e6b9a1a",
  "number_of_tickets": 100,
  "start_time": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "title": "The best show ever",
  "venue": "The best venue ever"
}
```

Show ID should be generated by you - it's not provided in the API request.

This will be sent to `POST /shows`.

## Exercise

File: `project/main.go`

Implement the `POST /shows` endpoint.
It should return the `201 Created` status code and return JSON containing `show_id`:

```json
{
  "show_id": "d0b9d5a0-8e1f-4b1a-9f1a-0e8f5e6b9a1a"
}
```

It should be our show ID (not the Dead Nation's ID).

It should add the show to the `shows` table.
The table name is important: We'll use it to verify your solution.

Note that just the Dead Nation's ID is sent via the endpoint.
We recommend generating an ID that we will use internally and won't be dependent on external systems.
It can be called just `ShowID`.

After getting rid of Dead Nation, we'll be able to remvove the `dead_nation_id` field without causing any impact on our system.
