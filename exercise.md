# Removing canceled tickets

Did you remember that it's possible to cancel tickets?
We should reflect this in our API as well.


<div class="alert alert-dismissible bg-info text-white d-flex flex-column flex-sm-row p-7 mb-10">
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
        <h3 class="mb-5 text-white">
			Background	
		</h3>
        <span>

The team that requested the API said that they don't need information about ticket status —
 they just need to know the tickets that were not canceled.

## Exercise

File: `project/main.go`

Implement a handler that listens for the `TicketBookingCanceled` event and removes canceled tickets from the database.


<div class="alert alert-dismissible bg-light-primary d-flex flex-column flex-sm-row p-7 mb-10">
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
        <h3 class="mb-5 text-dark">
			<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-lightbulb text-primary" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

Some of you may note that we should take into consideration the fact that messages can be out of order.
This is true, but for simplicity, let's assume that messages won't be out of order.

We will devote an entire module to tackling this problem later.
