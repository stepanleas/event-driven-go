Another thing that Dead Nation handles is refunds.
This is a perfect case for commands: We want to process this request asynchronously because the invoicing system and payment
provider are not stable, and the chance of failure is high.

## Exercise

File: `project/main.go`

Implement the `PUT /ticket-refund/:ticket_id` endpoint that will handle refunds.
In this exercise, we want to publish the command `RefundTicket` to the topic `"RefundTicket"`.
`RefundTicket` should contain just `ticket_id`.

You should use `CommandBus` in an analogous way to `EventBus`.

You may notice that `/ticket-refund/:ticket_id` is not 100% RESTful â€” and that's fine!
The REST API is not a silver bullet, and not everything fits nicely into the REST resources model.
That's especially the case when you need to support a lot of operations on one resource.
You would probably end up with a lot of magic under the hood to map PATCH requests to commands.

In some scenarios, it makes sense to build your API as a set of operations that the user can perform on your system.
(like issuing ticket refunds).

Instead of thinking about resources, you can think about forms that you may be submitting to the government office.
A list of endpoints shows what kinds of forms are supported.

Make sure you use the right configuration for the `CommandBus`.
Misconfiguration will lead to emitting commands to the wrong topic.

Remember, logs are your friends!
