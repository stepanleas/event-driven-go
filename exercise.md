Our operations team is now generating and printing tickets by hand.
This was a good strategy to roll out the product quickly, but it's not a good long-term solution because
they already struggle with the number of tickets they need to print.

Let's help our ops team by generating tickets for them!

We will use the `files` service to store the tickets.
The `files` will be available via the `gateway`, like other services.

## Exercise

File: `project/main.go`

Implement an event handler that will be triggered by the `TicketBookingConfirmed` event.

It should store ticket content with the API client `*clients.Clients` from the `github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/go-event-driven/common/clients`
(`Files.PutFilesFileIdContentWithTextBodyWithResponse(ctx, fileID, fileContent)` method).

The file name should have the format `[Ticket ID]-ticket.html`.
The content doesn't matter, it's just important that it contain the ticket ID, price, and amount.

It's not necessary to do anything on `TicketBookingCanceled` â€” the volume of this is low, and it's not a problem for ops to handle it.

Do you remember the discussion of eventual consistency? The client will return 409 when the file already exists.
We will use a similar strategy as in the previous module. If this error happens, you need to handle it gracefully.
It's worth adding a log in that situation, so you will know what happened in case any issues arise.

```go
import (
	"github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/go-event-driven/common/log"
)

if resp.StatusCode() == http.StatusConflict {
	log.FromContext(ctx).Infof("file %s already exists", fileID)
	return nil
}
```

Note that we can add this functionality without changing any existing code.
In real life, it could be even implemented by a different team that has access to the events.
