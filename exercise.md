# Time for Refactoring!

During development, we might not always have the necessary time to implement everything in the most optimal way. 
Sometimes, we may find that our initial assumptions don't hold true.

As our project continues to grow, the right moment may come for some refactoring. 
This will help maintain the code's simplicity and manageability for future exercises.

## Exercise

File: `project/main.go`

In this module, we will focus on component testing.
It may be worthwhile to refactor the code in a way that it will be easier to test and extend in the future.
Did you cut corners somewhere? Can you improve the code in some way?
It's a good time to pause for a moment and think about this. 
It's often good to do this in a real project after achieving a milestone â€” there is always some technical debt we can repay.

In this module, we're not introducing any new functionality. 
If there are areas in the code, you feel could benefit from improvement, go ahead and enhance them. 
However, if you believe your code is already perfect, feel free to submit the solution without making any changes. 

On our side, we introduced a few packages so it's easier to understand what's going on.
If you're looking for inspiration, you can return to this exercise and check the solution.

There is no perfect way of organizing code.

You don't need to follow exactly the same layout as we do in the example solution.
We used a format that would be easy to understand by anyone.
**You don't need to replicate this layout in your project. Use what works best for you.**

Usually, we would use the Clean Architecture approach.
This is out of the scope of this training, as we want to keep it easy to understand for everyone.
If you want to experiment with Clean Architecture, please check our ["Introducing Clean Architecture" article](https://threedots.tech/post/introducing-clean-architecture/).
